## Step 2: Add Cameras and Set Parameters
 
Now that we have created a new project, we can start adding cameras and setting their parameters. To add a camera, click on the "Add Camera" button on the toolbar or select "Edit -> Add Camera" from the menu. You will see a dialog box where you can choose a camera model from the database or enter your own parameters manually. For this example, we will choose a camera model from the database. We will use an Axis P3367-V dome camera with a 3-9 mm varifocal lens and a 5 MP resolution.

In this article, we will show you how to use NX Post Builder to create and edit postprocessors for your CNC machines. We will also provide you with some useful resources and tips to help you get started.
  
## What is NX Post Builder?
  
NX Post Builder is an application that comes with NX CAM software. It enables you to create and edit postprocessors for your CNC machines. A postprocessor is a software module that converts the toolpath data from NX CAM into machine-specific code that can be executed by your CNC controller.
  
NX Post Builder has a graphical user interface that allows you to define the postprocessor parameters, such as output format, machine kinematics, cycles, events, variables, and custom commands. You can also use the Tool Command Language (TCL) scripting language to add more functionality and logic to your postprocessor.
  
NX Post Builder supports various types of controllers, such as 3-axis, 4-axis, 5-axis, mill-turn, lathe, and more. You can also use the template posts that are provided by Siemens or download them from the Post Hub cloud-based library. You can modify these template posts to suit your specific needs.

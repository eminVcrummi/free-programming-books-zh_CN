Parayi Petta Panthirukulam is a Malayalam phrase that means "twelve castes born of a Pariah woman". It is a popular folktale in Kerala that tells the story of Vararuchi, a Brahmin scholar and one of the nine gems of Emperor Vikramaditya's court, and his wife Panchami, a Pariah woman who gave birth to twelve children of different castes and professions. The folktale is a rich source of cultural and historical information about Kerala and its diverse communities.

The story goes that Vararuchi was cursed by his guru to marry a Pariah woman and wander around the world. He met Panchami, a beautiful Pariah woman who was also cursed by a sage to become a Pariah after she unknowingly served him beef. They fell in love and got married. Panchami became pregnant twelve times and each time she gave birth, Vararuchi asked her if the child had a mouth. When she said yes, he told her to abandon the child in the forest, as he believed that God would provide for anyone who had a mouth. Panchami obeyed him every time, except for the last child, whom she hid under her armpit. Vararuchi then asked her if she had any unfulfilled wishes. She said that she wanted to see all her children. Vararuchi agreed and they set out to find them.
 
They discovered that each of their children had survived and grown up to become prominent members of different castes and professions. The first child was Mezhathol Agnihothri, a Namboothiri Brahmin and a renowned Vedic scholar. The second child was Pakkanar, a Pariah who made earthen pots and cremated the dead. The third child was Naranath Bhranthan, a madman who rolled big stones up hills and laughed when they fell down. The fourth child was Vayillakunnilappan, a temple priest who ate a lot. The fifth child was Perumthachan, a carpenter and an architect who built temples and palaces. The sixth child was Uppukottan, a salt merchant and a philanthropist. The seventh child was Akavoor Chathan, a physician and a minister. The eighth child was Karakkal Amma, the only daughter who became a poetess and a dancer. The ninth child was Uliyannoor Perumthachan, another carpenter and an architect who was the rival of his elder brother. The tenth child was Vallon, a brave warrior and a leader of the Ezhava caste. The eleventh child was Vethakorumakan, an astrologer and a magician. The twelfth child was Pananar, a musician and a singer.

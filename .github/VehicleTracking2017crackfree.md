## How to Use Vehicle Tracking for Swept Path Analysis
 
Vehicle Tracking is a software that allows you to analyze and predict the movement of steered vehicles, light rail vehicles, and aircraft. You can use it to design roads, intersections, parking lots, roundabouts, and other transportation facilities. One of the main features of Vehicle Tracking is swept path analysis, which shows how a vehicle maneuvers through a predefined path.
 
To use Vehicle Tracking for swept path analysis, you need to follow these steps:

1. Open Vehicle Tracking from AutoCAD, Civil 3D, or InfraWorks.
2. Select the Vehicle Tracking tab and click on the Vehicle Library button.
3. Choose a vehicle from the library or create your own custom vehicle.
4. Click on the Drive Vehicle button and select a starting point on the drawing.
5. Use the mouse or keyboard to steer the vehicle along the desired path. You can also use the Auto Drive option to automatically follow a selected alignment or polyline.
6. Click on the Finish button to end the drive and display the swept path analysis.
7. You can modify the swept path by changing the vehicle parameters, editing the drive points, or using grips and commands.
8. You can also add annotations, dimensions, clearance envelopes, and other details to the swept path.

Vehicle Tracking can help you design safer and more efficient transportation facilities by simulating how different vehicles move and interact with each other and the environment.
